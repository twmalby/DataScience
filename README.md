# Analysis of Dataset with Over 100,000 Records on Airline Service Feedback
# Evaluating airline passenger satisfaction:

 Data: Passenger characteristics, satisfaction ratings, and flight information.

 Objectives: Predict passenger satisfaction and identify key factors influencing satisfaction levels.

## Introduction

In this GitHub repository, we present an analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing feedback from customers who have availed services from an airline company. The dataset comprises over 100,000 records, each containing 25 columns of valuable information.

## Statistical Studies

To gain initial insights into the dataset, we conducted basic statistical studies. We calculated percentages to understand the demographic distribution, including gender, age, and other relevant variables of the consumers.

## PCA and Covariance Matrix Analysis

To explore potential linear correlations among the variables, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and covariance matrix analysis. Surprisingly, our analysis did not reveal any significant linear correlations, highlighting the complexity of the dataset.

## Machine Learning with Random Forest

To delve deeper into customer satisfaction, we applied the Random Forest algorithm. Our preliminary findings suggest a noteworthy observation - customers who made online bookings appeared to be more satisfied than others. This intriguing discovery will be subject to further investigation to uncover the underlying reasons.
